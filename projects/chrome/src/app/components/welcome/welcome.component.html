    <summary>Important for Cashu wallet users</summary>
    <p>
      Browser sync storage is limited to ~100KB shared across all data
      (identities, permissions, relays, and Cashu tokens).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you plan to use the Cashu ecash wallet with significant balances,
      choose <strong>"Sync OFF"</strong> which provides ~5MB of local storage
      (enough for ~18,000+ tokens vs ~300-400 with sync).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Cashu tokens are bearer assets. If you lose your
      vault backup, you lose your tokens permanently. Make sure to configure
      regular backups.
    </p>
